# Language Server Protocol types for Go

This is a (work-in-progress) module that contains type definitions and
documentation for the [Language Server Protocol Specification][lsp-spec]. It
aims to provide up-to-date and clear definitions to use in a language server.

## Future Plans

Future plans for this module include designing a language server SDK,
effectively making the module a swiss-army knife for creating language servers
in Go easily.

## License

MIT. Type declarations and documentations are taken from the
[official specification document][lsp-spec].
